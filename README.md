# Notes App - Developed Using Flutter and Hive Library

#### The Notes App is a cross-platform application developed using the Flutter platform, allowing users of both Android and iOS operating systems to benefit from it. The app features a set of useful functionalities, including:

###### - Ability to add new notes with the option to choose their colors, with the app automatically timestamping the addition.
###### - Ability to edit existing notes, enabling users to modify and customize them according to their needs.
###### - Ability to delete notes when they are no longer needed or relevant.
 ###### - Local storage is implemented using the Hive library, which enables storing data without the need for an internet connection, relying on a Local None SQL database.

##### The BLOC state management pattern and MVVP design pattern are employed in the app development, ensuring efficient organization and management of data and presentation.
